# 6561

6561 is implemented in Python and uses Tkinter as the GUI framework.

## Basic Rules
6561 is a new variation of the well-known game, 2048.
The goal is to create 6561, a power of 3.

## An Interesting Twist
6561 starts with two 3's in a 3x3 grid. When a user moves the cells using arrow-keys, the grid adds 3 with 60% probability, and adds 1 with 40% probability. 1 is introduced as an obstacle to make the game a bit more challenging, because 1 can't be combined with power of 3. 

Probability is set in this way to manage the difficulty of the game. You may modify the probability to make 6561 even harder! 

## Can I restart the game? 
Without having to quit and restart the entire GUI, the player is also allowed to restart the game by simply pressing R.
